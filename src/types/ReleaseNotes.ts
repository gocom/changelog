  /**
   * Template strings.
   *
   * The template is passed down to handlebars, allowing the use of variables and handlebars templating language
   * to format the release notes. Available template variables include the properties from the {@link Changelog}
   * object and others:
   *
   * - `{{isPrerelease}}`
   * - `{{notes}}`
   * - `{{title}}`
   * - `{{version}}`
   * - `{{major}}`
   * - `{{minor}}`
   * - `{{patch}}`
   *
   * See {@link defaultReleaseNotesTemplate} for the default template. If the given template is an array of templates,
   * resulting contents are joined together as separate paragraphs. Templates that evaluate empty, are skipped. This
   * allows wrapping the templates into if conditionals, omitting the template, if it is not needed.
   *
   * @see [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/)
