/**
 * Regular expression used for splitting changelog sections into parts.
 *
 * The regex looks for version number heading from the Markdown content, and splits the document by them.
 *
 * When passed down to {@link String.split}, we end up with each capture group in a flat array, from where
 * each item can be chunked into grouped objects.

/**
 * Parses the given changelog document content.
 *
 * Extracts full changelog per each version from the given Markdown formatted changelog document. In the document,
 * each released version would be its own section, separated by Markdown headings, followed by the release
 * notes. The heading should contain the version number in semantic versioning format, and release notes would be
 * written under the heading.
 *
 * The changelog document can contain leading and trailing content after the version number sections, and other
 * non-changelog sections, under non-version number headings; those will be ignored.
 *
 * Returned version changelogs array will be sorted by version numbers according to semantic versioning rules in
 * descending order. The highest version will be the first array item, and the lowest, the last.
 *
 * @param {string} contents Markdown changelog contents.
 * @return {Changelog[]} Returns an array of changes per version.
 * @group Library
 * @category API
 * @example
 * The following would parse the given Markdown formatted changelog:
 * ```ts
 * import {parse} from '@gocom/changelog';
 *
 * const changelog = parse(`
 * # Changelog
 *
 * ### 1.1.0-alpha.1
 *
 * * Change 1.
 * * Change 2.
 *
 * ### 1.0.0 ðŸš€
 *
 * * Initial public release.
 * `);
 * ```
 * The above `changelog` variable would become:
 * ```typescript
 * [
 *   {
 *     version: '1.1.0-alpha.1',
 *     isPrerelease: true,
 *     titleStart: '',
 *     titleEnd: '',
 *     notes: '* Change 1.\n* Change 2.'
 *   },
 *   {
 *     version: '1.0.0',
 *     isPrerelease: false,
 *     titleStart: '',
 *     titleEnd: 'ðŸš€',
 *     notes: '* Initial public release.'
 *   }
 * ]
 * ```
